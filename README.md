# Flappy-Bird-Java
Oversimplified version of flappy bird that brings back the nostalgia of when the game was in its prime.

##How to play
Start bu downloading or cloning the repository, and in eclipse or any java ide, navigate to the new local repo and run the program. Easy as that!
Will be adding a link to a downloadable .exe in the near future.
